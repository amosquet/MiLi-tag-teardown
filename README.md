Teardown of the MiLi bluetooth tracker for Android & iOS

images with measurements will be added soon.

The tracker is powered by a CR2032 single-cell "coin" battery.
It can be powered by applying 3V/1A DC, this is enough to power the device, enabling tracking and beeping.

Opening the tag is quite trivial. I used a small flathead screwdriver and some iFixit "Opening Picks" (essentially guitar picks).
1. remove back cover and battery.
2. get the screwdriver between the seams near where the keyring hole is and pry. You can also use a gap to the right of the keyring hole.
3. pry using the screwdriver, picks, and your hands if needed
When I opened it, the shell got damaged, though no hardware got damaged, there's no putting this back together.

While trying to solder leads to power it with a DC powersupply, I noticed that soldering was quite difficult. It seems some sort of wax or coating was applied to prevent soldering, though it could be a byproduct of the IP68 treatment. This coating can be removed by rubbing the hot iron tip on the area you want to solder to, before applying any solder.
This coating is on the small buzzer/speaker aswell.
